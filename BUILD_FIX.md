# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The original plugin was using the deprecated Google Play Services Credentials API which has been removed from newer versions of Google Play Services, causing compilation errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Deprecated Credentials API
- Removed imports for `com.google.android.gms.auth.api.credentials.*`
- Removed `play-services-auth` dependency
- Kept only `play-services-auth-api-phone` for SMS functionality

### 2. Updated OTPReader.java
- Removed `getPhoneNumberHint()` method that used deprecated Credentials API
- Added `getPhoneNumber()` method using TelephonyManager
- Removed credential-related activity result handling
- Simplified the plugin to focus on SMS functionality

### 3. Updated JavaScript Interface
- Replaced `getPhoneNumberHint()` with `getPhoneNumber()`
- Updated method signatures and documentation

### 4. Updated Dependencies
**Before:**
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:21.0.0'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth-api-phone:18.0.2'
}
```

**After:**
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth-api-phone:18.0.2'
}
```

### 5. Updated Examples and Documentation
- Updated all example files to use `getPhoneNumber()` instead of `getPhoneNumberHint()`
- Updated README.md with correct API documentation
- Updated TESTING.md with appropriate test cases

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Compatibility**: Works with latest Android SDK and Google Play Services
2. **Simplified**: Removed complex credential management
3. **Privacy-focused**: Still maintains SMS User Consent for privacy compliance
4. **Functional**: Core OTP reading functionality preserved and enhanced

## Alternative Phone Number Access

The new `getPhoneNumber()` method:
- Uses TelephonyManager to get device phone number
- Requires READ_PHONE_STATE permission (already included)
- May not work on all devices/carriers (carrier-dependent)
- Provides graceful error handling when not available

## Migration Notes

If you were using `getPhoneNumberHint()`:
```javascript
// Old (deprecated)
cordova.plugins.OTPReader.getPhoneNumberHint(success, error);

// New (working)
cordova.plugins.OTPReader.getPhoneNumber(success, error);
```

The functionality is similar but uses a different underlying API that's still supported.
